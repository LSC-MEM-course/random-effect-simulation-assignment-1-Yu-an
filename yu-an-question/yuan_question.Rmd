The data is an experiment I did with Mandarin-speaking three-year-olds. The study is a modified version of Truth Value Judgment Task. Instead of saying true/false, the kids have to decide whether they need to answer to a wh-question or respond to a declarative.

```{r}
yy_data <- read.csv("/Users/ceshi/Documents/Work/Rscripts/Multi_level_models/group_session/random-effect-simulation-assignment-1-Yu-an/yu-an-question/data.csv")
```

The dependent variable is "yn", whether the response from participant contains a 'yes/no' marker. The independent varialbe is "dou" (whether the test sentence has a morpheme "dou") and "some_all", whether the scenario in a story is a "some" scenario, or a "all" scenario.
